this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore— merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore— let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore— tis the wind and nothing more open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door— perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door— perched and sat and nothing more  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore— tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermore but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before— on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermore startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of never—nevermore but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore— what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvetviolet lining with the lamplight gloating oer she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil—prophet still if bird or devil— whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted— on this home by horror haunted—tell me truly i implore— is there—is there balm in gilead?—tell me—tell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil—prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us—by that god we both adore— tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore— clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting— get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken—quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted—nevermore";

let prideStr = "it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife  however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters  my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?  mr bennet replied that he had not  but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it  mr bennet made no answer  do you not want to know who has taken it? cried his wife impatiently  you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it  this was invitation enough  why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week  what is his name?  bingley  is he married or single?  oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls  how so? how can it affect them?  my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them  is that his design in settling here?  design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes  i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party  my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty  in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of  but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood  it is more than i engage for i assure you  but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not  you are overscrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy  i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference  they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters  mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves  you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least  ah you do not know what i suffer  but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood  it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them  depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all  mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news          mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with  i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy  we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit  but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him  i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her  no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you  mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters  don't keep coughing so kitty for heaven's sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces  kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill  i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy?  tomorrow fortnight  aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself  then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her  impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing?  i honour your circumspection a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself  the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense  what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts  mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how  while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley  i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife  i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before? if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now  the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while  how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now  now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife  what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball  oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i'm the tallest  the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner          not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained  if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for  in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse  an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london—his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man  mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend  mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters  elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it  come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance  i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with  i would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty  you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet  oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you  which do you mean? and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me  mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous  the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt jane's pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear  oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger—  if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god's sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance  oh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst's gown—  here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy  but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the man          when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him  he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners—so much ease with such perfect good breeding  he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete  i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment  did not you? i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person  dear lizzy  oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life  i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i think  i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone and so you like this man's sisters too do you? their manners are not equal to his  certainly not—at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her  elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade  mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase  his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for halfanhour—was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately  between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offense  the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much  mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose          within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st james's had made him courteous  lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeth's intimate friend  that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate  you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas you were mr bingley's first choice  yes but he seemed to like his second better  oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed i rather believe he did—i heard something about it—but i hardly know what—something about mr robinson  perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you? mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question 'oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point'  upon my word well that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but however it may all come to nothing you know  my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he?—poor eliza—to be only just tolerable  i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips  are you quite sure ma'am?—is not there a little mistake? said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her  aye—because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to  miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintances with them he is remarkably agreeable  i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise  i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza  another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you  i believe ma'am i may safely promise you never to dance with him  his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud  that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine  pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us  if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day  then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly  the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit          the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was soon returned in due form miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas  it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on  but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too  remember eliza that he does not know jane's disposition as you do  but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out  perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses  your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane's feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined with him in company four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character  not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal  yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded  well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life  you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself  occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with  he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucas's where a large party were assembled  what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?  that is a question which mr darcy only can answer  but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him  on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said  did you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?  with great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic  you are severe on us  it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows  you are a very strange creature by way of a friend—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucas's persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge' and i shall keep mine to swell my song  her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display  mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room  mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began  what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society  certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance  sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy  you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir  yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james's?  never sir  do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?  it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it  you have a house in town i conclude?  mr darcy bowed  i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas  he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her  my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing? mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william  indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner  mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion  you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhour  mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling  he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?  elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley  i can guess the subject of your reverie  i should imagine not  you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise—the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people what would i give to hear your strictures on them  your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow  miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darcy replied with great intrepidity  miss elizabeth bennet  miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite?—and pray when am i to wish you joy?  that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady's imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy  nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is absolutely settled you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will always be at pemberley with you  he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long          mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother's fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds  she had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade  the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters' and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters  their visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingley's large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign  after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed  from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced  catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london  i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybody's children it should not be of my own however  if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it  yes—but as it happens they are all of them very clever  this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish  my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well—and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals  mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library  mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read  well jane who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love  it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud  my dear friend—  if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day's teteatete between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers—yours ever  caroline bingley  with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that  dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky  can i have the carriage? said jane  no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night  that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home  oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs  i had much rather go in the coach  but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are they not?  they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them  but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mother's purpose will be answered  she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back  this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth  my dearest lizzy—  i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with me—yours etc  well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders  oh i am not afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage  elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution  how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there  i shall be very fit to see jane—which is all i want  is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses?  no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner  i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required  we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together  if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes  in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise  she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast  her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her  when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere  when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes          at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley's she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike  their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her  when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added  she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild  she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy so blowsy  yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office  your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice  you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition  certainly not  to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum  it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley  i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes  not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again  i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it  i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton  yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside  that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily  if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable  but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy  to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations  with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment  do you prefer reading to cards? said he that is rather singular  miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else  i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things  in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well  elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others—all that his library afforded  and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into  elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room  i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy  it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations  and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books  i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these  neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley  i wish it may  but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire  with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it  i am talking of possibilities charles  upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation  elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game  is miss darcy much grown since the spring? said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am?  i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height or rather taller  how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite  it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are  all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean?  yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished  your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished  nor i i am sure said miss bingley  then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman  yes i do comprehend a great deal in it  oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but halfdeserved  all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading  i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any  are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?  i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united  mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room  elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art  undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable  miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject  elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister          elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgement of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast  had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected  indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness  removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal  you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us  mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments  i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease  whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here  that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth  you begin to comprehend me do you? cried he turning towards her  oh yes—i understand you perfectly  i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful  that is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours  lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home  i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study  yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage  the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society  but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever  yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town  everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph  i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not mr bingley?  when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either  aye—that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all  indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be true  certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty families  nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away  yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he? so much the man of fashion so genteel and easy he has always something to say to everybody that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter  did charlotte dine with you?  no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend  she seems a very pleasant young woman  oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane's beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane—one does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were  and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love  i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy  of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away  darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield  lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear  i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill  lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes—it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not  mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes           the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom the lootable however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game  elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of each  how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter  he made no answer  you write uncommonly fast  you are mistaken i write rather slowly  how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year letters of business too how odious i should think them  it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours  pray tell your sister that i long to see her  i have already told her so once by your desire  i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well  thank you—but i always mend my own  how can you contrive to write so even?  he was silent  tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's  will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice  oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy?  they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine  it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill  that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy?  my style of writing is very different from yours  oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest  my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents  your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof  nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast  and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?  the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?  nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies  i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say 'bingley you had better stay till next week' you would probably do it you would probably not go—and at another word might stay a month  you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself  i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could  would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?  upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself  you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety  to yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you  to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either  you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it?  will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?  by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do  mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense  i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this  perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me  what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter  mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter  when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself  mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation  after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her  do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?  she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence  oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say 'yes' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare  indeed i do not dare  elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger  miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth  she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance  i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses  have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?  oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your greatuncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeth's picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?  it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied  at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself  i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard  you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out  then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said  this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue  but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered  no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth goodbye  she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening"
