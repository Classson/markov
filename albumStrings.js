sun's all prickly on my neck when the helicopter passes we both hit the deck hands grasping and groping seizing opportunity right where it lies the sky will fall we will rise my love is like a powder keg my love is like a powder keg in the corner of an empty warehouse somewhere just outside of town about to burn down my love is like a cuban plane my love is like a cuban plane flying from havana up the florida coast to the 'glades soviet made our love is like the border between greece and albania our love is like the border between greece and albania trucks loaded down with weapons crossing over every night moon yellow and bright there is a shortage in the blood supply but there is no shortage of blood the way i feel about you baby can't explain it you got the best of my love tile floor of the bathroom scrubbed clean and bright checkerboard white and grey towels from the ritzcarlton hotel in kingston jamaica i can still see the rust colored stains today the stage is set someone's going to do something someone else will regret i speak in smoke signals and you answer in code the fuse will have to run out sometime something here will eventually have to explode have to explode you and me lying on the tile floor trying to keep cool restless all night sweating out the poison as the temperature climbs staring up up at the hundredwatt light that burns above name one thing about us two anyone could love we roll out the red carpet when rotten luck comes down the road five four three two one watch for the flash something here will eventually have to explode have to explode from the housetops to the gutters from the ocean to the shore the warning signs have all been bright and garish far too great in number to ignore from the cities to the swamplands from the highways to the hills our love has never had a leg to stand on from the aspirins to the crosstops to the elevils but i will walk down to the end with you if you will come all the way down with me from the entrance to the exit is longer than it looks from where we stand i want to say i'm sorry for stuff i haven't done yet things will shortly get completely out of hand i can feel it in the rotten air tonight in the tips of my fingers in the skin on my face in the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light in the way those eyes i've always loved illuminate this place like a trashcan fire in a prison cell like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell i will walk down to the end with you if you will come all the way down with me well guy in a skeleton costume comes up to the guy in the superman suit runs through him with a broadsword i flipped the television off bring all the bright lights up turn the radio up loud i don't know why i'm so persuaded that if i think things through long enough and hard enough i'll somehow get to you but then you came in and we locked eyes you kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall quickly lit another look at that would you look at that? we're throwing off sparks what will i do when i don't have you to hold onto in the dark? yes everybody's going to need a witness everybody's going to need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty you throw the attic window open and i throw myself all around you and night comes to tallahassee i don't know why it's gotten harder to keep myself away thought i'd finally beat the feeling back it all came back today and then we fell down and we locked arms we knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor i don't mean it when i tell you that i don't love you any more look at that would you look at that? the way the ceiling starts to swerve what will i do when i don't have you when i finally get what i deserve? ah the lengthening hours in the refinery belching fire into the sky we do our best vampire routines as we suck the dying hours dry the night is lovely as a rose if i see sunlight hit you i am sure that we'll both decompose ah the fitful sleep and the fire engines that i dream of when i dream some day we'll both wake up for good i will try hard not to scream the evening wind will shake the blinds you're stirring from your slumber we've got something hateful on our minds oh sing sing sing for the dying of the day sing for the flames that will rip through here and the smoke that will carry us away yeah sing for the damage we've done and the worse things that we'll do open your mouth up and sing for me now and i will sing for you";

let theRaven = "once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door— only this and nothing more ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow—vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost lenore— for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore— nameless here for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— this it is and nothing more presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you—here i opened wide the door— darkness there and nothing more deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore? this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore— merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore— let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore— tis the wind and nothing more open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door— perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door— perched and sat and nothing more  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore— tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermore but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before— on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermore startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of never—nevermore but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore— what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvetviolet lining with the lamplight gloating oer she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil—prophet still if bird or devil— whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted— on this home by horror haunted—tell me truly i implore— is there—is there balm in gilead?—tell me—tell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil—prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us—by that god we both adore— tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore— clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting— get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken—quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted—nevermore"
